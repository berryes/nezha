 Basic discord music bot.


### Short story
After making [Xavyer](https://github.com/berryes/xavyer), a mutlifunctional discord bot built with random ass features my brain farted out. I used xavy to entertain me and people around my server.
 I have decided to scrap the project due to its nested and hard to read code. It was my first ever JS project that tougth me Discord.JS and well... javascript.
Now after experimenting around my server I have come to a conclusion that a music bot is all I need. So I'm rewriting Xavyer. (Something like refactoring)
